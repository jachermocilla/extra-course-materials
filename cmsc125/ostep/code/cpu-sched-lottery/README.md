## Proportional Share Scheduling

Code from OSTEP chapter [Scheduling: Proportional Share](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf).

Compile with:

```
prompt> gcc -o lottery lottery.c -Wall
```

Run like this:

```
./lottery 1 100
```

which uses random seed '1' to run a little lottery 100 different times.

Read the source code for details.
